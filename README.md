### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you!

I am a web developer in training that specializes in front and back end web development. I am an artistic person with a passion for creating beautiful websites and code. I am currently a coding boot camp at the University of Washington and live in Seattle. I am looking to collaborate on new projects that will grow my skills.

My previous career, as a project management consultant at Microsoft, peaked my interests and appreciation for technology and innovation. I am known by clients and peers for my determination to solve complex problems and motivation to deliver high quality finished products. 

My portfolio will feature numerous websites that demonstrate my sharp knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, agile methodology, computer science and more. I am currently seeking a role as a web developer at a company where I can learn, grow, and continue to master the craft.

You can reach me via email: Starcevichh@gmail.com

Thanks!
